IntelliJ IDEA Plugin - Ant Debugger

This is a fork of AntDebugger v1.3.0 from https://github.com/opticyclic/antdebugger

It has been updated to compile and run with IDEA v13.

v1.2.0 was the first version that was compiled to work with IDEA v12. However, it had bugs and the extensions in IDEA have now changed enough in v13 to make it difficult work with IDEA v12 and v13.

v.1.3.0 is the current version. The plugin name has v1.2.0 in it because it wasn't renamed well during the fork.
